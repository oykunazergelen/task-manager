## 👤 Author’s Note
- Hello everyone, and thank you for checking out my project. I built this to deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to experiment with new methods as I learn more about web development.
Even though the project is simple, it has still been challenging at times—as expected for a student like me.

- As I continue learning backend and full-stack development (such as Node.js and MongoDB), I plan to update and expand this project over time.
Thank you for reading!
